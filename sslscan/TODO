- Take a URL as an argument
- Output to HTML like ssl digger
- Fix formatting of the certificate serial number and also the logo
- Certificate times in localtime as well as GMT
- PCI PASS or fail summary. This to be based on PCI-DSS glossary of strong crypto but make a warning about MEDIUM crypto RC4 ciphers
- Bullet format output suitable to paste into the strong crypto section of the PCI report
- Show the resolved IP addresses in the results
- Need to actually complete the https request each cipher suite to ensure that the server is not just returning an error about the use of a weak cipher. See http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX119993
- Perfect Forwarding Security (PFS) column
- NIST column
- Must include the date and time of the scan and where it was run from similar to the luhn_scan
- Colour the PASS and FAIL indication.
- option to control the timeout for SSL connection. Useful when no service is on port 443
- Automatic starttls for port 25 and 587
- starttls also for imap port 143. a001 CAPABILITY then a002 STARTTLS. See http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2595


Same too for SSH
- Show SSH versions supported
- Show ciphers supported
- ssh -v does this to.

Done
- Output cipher details including strength, key lengths etc
- This scan does not seem to show TLSv1 ciphers.
- Progress should not be logged to the output file
- Tool to scan for certificate expiry
- PCI and other compliance in the preferred cipher column
- Shorter output has only the accepted ciphers, Status, Version, Cipher, Strength, PCI and no certificate info. In fact drop all of the Status field except for verbose output
- Want to analyse the PCI compliance of the default ciphers
- The wide output display really messes up under windows dos box
- Want to analyse the PCI compliance of the certificate.
  -- Date range value
  -- Trusted signing authority
  -- RSA keys > 1024
  -- SHA1
